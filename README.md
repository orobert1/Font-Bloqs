In order to deal with binary data I had to write a class to read the binary and translate it into usable data. To do this I wrote a binary reader class that stores the position in the data as well as several methods for translation into numerical values. For example here is a function that I for retrieving an unsigned integer
  ``` javascript
  getUint8: function() {
      assert( this.pos < this.data.length );
      return this.data[this.pos++];
  }
  ```
